## What is this?
normal downloader with useless features

## How to use
Before using this downloader, I recommend to put the ffmpeg/ffprobe binary to the same directory of **EdibleDLP.ahk**
(or If you converted as exe, **EdibleDLP.exe**)

> [!NOTE]
> This program will automatically download the yt-dlp from yt-dlp repository (If yt-dlp doesn't exist at same directory), 
> but this will download the older versions that compatible wih Windows 7, so I also recommend to put latest version of yt-dlp, If you're using Windows 10 or above.

after that, launch the EdibleDLP. This program will download yt-dlp from repository of yt-dlp. After this is completed, the GUI will shown.
